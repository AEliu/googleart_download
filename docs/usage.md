# Usage

## Basic Download

```bash
uv run artx "https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/girl-with-a-pearl-earring/3QFHLJgXCmQm2Q" -o downloads
```

You can also pass:

- a full artwork URL
- an artwork URL with viewer query params such as `?ms=...`
- an official `g.co/arts/...` short link
- a bare asset id such as `3QFHLJgXCmQm2Q`

Download tiles only without stitching:

```bash
uv run artx "3QFHLJgXCmQm2Q" --tile-only
```

Create the final image later from an existing tile directory:

```bash
uv run artx --stitch-from-tiles "downloads/The Great Wave.tiles"
```

Recommended tile workflow:

```bash
uv run artx "3QFHLJgXCmQm2Q" --tile-only
uv run artx --stitch-from-tiles "downloads/The Great Wave.tiles"
```

## Input Files

Read one URL per line:

```bash
uv run artx --url-file urls.txt --tui
```

Equivalent artwork inputs are deduplicated before a batch starts. This applies to:

- full artwork URLs
- query-param variants
- `g.co` short links
- bare asset ids

## Batch Resume And Rerun

Resume a previously interrupted batch:

```bash
uv run artx --url-file urls.txt --resume-batch
```

Rerun only failed tasks from the previous batch state:

```bash
uv run artx --rerun-failed
```

Use `--resume-batch` when a batch stopped partway through and you want to continue it. Use `--rerun-failed` when you want a fresh batch containing only the tasks that failed last time.

Use a custom batch state file:

```bash
uv run artx --url-file urls.txt --batch-state-file state/downloads.json
```

Overlap download and stitching across adjacent artworks:

```bash
uv run artx --url-file urls.txt --pipeline-artworks
```

`--pipeline-artworks` is a batch-only throughput option. While artwork N is stitching, artwork N+1 may already be downloading its tiles. In the current implementation this overlap is fixed to one download phase plus one stitch phase rather than general multi-artwork parallel execution. With `--fail-fast` enabled in pipeline mode, new download phases stop after the first error; any already queued stitching will still complete to avoid leaving partial work.

## Retry And Parallelism

Adjust request retries:

```bash
uv run artx "3QFHLJgXCmQm2Q" --retries 5 --retry-backoff 1.0
```

Adjust tile download concurrency:

```bash
uv run artx "3QFHLJgXCmQm2Q" --workers 32
```

`--workers` controls tile download concurrency inside one artwork. Higher values can help on good networks, but may also increase rate limiting or retry pressure.

Adjust JPEG quality for JPEG outputs:

```bash
uv run artx "3QFHLJgXCmQm2Q" --jpeg-quality 85
uv run artx "3QFHLJgXCmQm2Q" --jpeg-preset balanced
```

`--jpeg-quality` applies to JPEG writes only. It does not force large artworks back to JPEG if the safe default path has switched them to TIFF/BigTIFF.
`--jpeg-preset` is a friendlier alias layer:

- `web` -> `75`
- `balanced` -> `85`
- `archive` -> `95`

`--jpeg-quality` and `--jpeg-preset` cannot be used together.

## Proxy Support

Note on memory/backends (Windows and non-POSIX): when the system cannot report available RAM, the tool uses a heuristic raw canvas threshold (~2 GiB) to decide whether to switch large images to the safer TIFF/BigTIFF path automatically. If `psutil` is installed, the tool can read available memory on more platforms to make a more precise decision.

Use an explicit proxy:

```bash
uv run artx "3QFHLJgXCmQm2Q" --proxy http://127.0.0.1:7890
```

SOCKS proxies are also supported when your environment and dependencies support them:

```bash
uv run artx "3QFHLJgXCmQm2Q" --proxy socks5://127.0.0.1:7890
```

You can also rely on standard proxy environment variables such as:

- `HTTP_PROXY`
- `HTTPS_PROXY`
- `ALL_PROXY`

If `--proxy` is provided, it takes precedence over environment proxy settings.

## Output Naming

By default:

- `--size max` keeps the base filename
- non-max preset sizes add a suffix such as `.preview`, `.medium`, `.large`
- `--max-dimension 8000` adds `.maxdim-8000`

Example:

- `The Starry Night.jpg`
- `The Starry Night.preview.jpg`
- `The Starry Night.maxdim-8000.jpg`

If you pass `--filename`, that explicit filename wins.

With `--tile-only`, the visible output becomes a directory ending in `.tiles` instead of a stitched image file.

Examples:

- `The Starry Night.tiles/`
- `The Starry Night.preview.tiles/`
- `The Starry Night.maxdim-8000.tiles/`

Each tile-only directory contains:

- `tiles/*.tile`
- `state.json`

Tile-only also uses a hidden stable cache under `.googleart-cache/`, keyed by artwork identity rather than the visible directory name. This means:

- the visible `.tiles/` directory is the user-facing result
- the hidden cache is what protects cache identity and resume correctness
- successful tile-only runs intentionally duplicate tile data into the visible `.tiles/` directory while keeping the hidden cache available for later reuse

## Output Conflict Policies

```bash
uv run artx --url-file urls.txt --output-conflict skip
uv run artx --url-file urls.txt --output-conflict overwrite
uv run artx --url-file urls.txt --output-conflict rename
```

`--output-conflict` applies to the output that the current command would write:

- normal download: the final image file
- `--tile-only`: the visible `.tiles/` directory
- `--stitch-from-tiles`: the final stitched image

Behavior:

- `skip`: default, and only skip when that existing output is already the correct finished result
- `overwrite`: replace existing output
- `rename`: write `.2`, `.3`, and so on

For `--tile-only`, these policies apply to the `.tiles` directory:

- `skip`: if the directory already contains a complete tile set for the same artwork, report it as skipped
- `overwrite`: remove the existing `.tiles` directory and download again
- `rename`: create a new sibling directory such as `The Starry Night.2.tiles`

If an existing `.tiles` directory belongs to a different artwork, tile-only continues the download instead of reporting skipped.

For `--stitch-from-tiles`, the same conflict policies apply to the final stitched image output path.

`--no-skip-existing` is kept as a compatibility flag and is equivalent to `--output-conflict overwrite`.

## Inspect Sizes Before Download

```bash
uv run artx "3QFHLJgXCmQm2Q" --list-sizes
```

Size inspection reports:

- pixel dimensions
- tile count
- raw canvas memory estimate
- whether the selected backend path would remain JPEG or switch to TIFF

If a row defaults to TIFF/BigTIFF, that is still the normal safe success path for large artwork stitching rather than an unexpected failure mode.

## TUI And Logging

```bash
uv run artx --url-file urls.txt --tui --log-file logs/run.log -v
```

<a href="assets/tui-preview.svg">
  <img src="assets/tui-overview.svg" alt="TUI overview" />
</a>

The CLI can show:

- download rate
- ETA
- estimated finish time
- retry count
- current phase

## Constraints

- `--filename` is only valid for a single download target.
- `--resume-batch` and `--rerun-failed` cannot be combined.
- `--pipeline-artworks` requires a batch with at least two artwork URLs.
- `--pipeline-artworks` cannot be combined with `--tile-only` or `--stitch-from-tiles`.
- `--metadata-only` cannot be combined with `--list-sizes`.
- `--tile-only` cannot be combined with `--metadata-only`, `--list-sizes`, `--write-metadata`, `--write-sidecar`, or an explicit non-`auto` `--stitch-backend`.
- `--stitch-from-tiles` cannot be combined with artwork URLs, `--url-file`, batch resume/rerun flags, `--metadata-only`, `--list-sizes`, `--tile-only`, `--write-metadata`, or `--write-sidecar`.
